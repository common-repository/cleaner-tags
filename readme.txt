Cleaner Tags finds the top 10 tags being used in your site and organizes them in a neat, ascending list

== Description ==
Cleaner Tags is a Wordpress Plugin I created as an alternative to messy tag clouds.

It finds the top 10 tags being used in your site and organizes them in a neat, ascending list.

This is a beta 0.1 release, very minimal code, and (of course) no tables added to the database. If enough people like it Iâ€™ll add some additional functionality. Thanks!
